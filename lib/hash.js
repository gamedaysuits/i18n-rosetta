/**
 * Source content hash manifest — detects when English copy changes.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 *   After each successful sync, we store a SHA-256 hash of every source
 *   value in a lock file (.i18n-rosetta.lock). On the next sync, we
 *   compare the current source values against the stored hashes. Any
 *   key whose hash differs means the English copy changed and all
 *   translations for that key are now stale.
 *
 * WHY:
 *   Without this, changing "Ship your product" to "Launch your product"
 *   in en.json leaves every target locale with the old translation.
 *   The diff engine only detects missing keys and [EN] fallbacks — not
 *   content mutations. This hash layer closes that gap automatically.
 *
 * FILE FORMAT:
 *   .i18n-rosetta.lock is a JSON file mapping dot-notation keys to
 *   their SHA-256 hash. It should be committed to version control so
 *   that all developers and CI share the same baseline.
 *
 *   {
 *     "nav.home": "a1b2c3...",
 *     "nav.about": "d4e5f6...",
 *     ...
 *   }
